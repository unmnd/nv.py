# Writing your first node (Python)

Wow, now you have a good overview of what the **nv** network is, and how itâ€™s supposed to work, itâ€™s about time to start writing your own nodes!

Ensure the Redis server is running and accessible, launch your favourite text editor or IDE, and create a new file called `my_first_node.py`.

Every node is built off the `Node` class, which can be imported from the `nv` package.

```python
from nv import Node
import time
```

This `Node` class is used as the base to build the rest of your node. We will be focussing on an object-oriented approach to programming from this point on, however the class can be used in a more functional approach as well.

Inherit the `Node` class into our own class, `HelloWorldNode`, and add an initialisation method. The `__init__` method is already used by the parent `Node` class to perform important initialisation steps, so itâ€™s vital to call that parent method. Itâ€™s best to do that before any other initialisation code.

```python
class HelloWorldNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("my_first_node")
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Define the name of the node by passing it to the `__init__` method as an argument.

This initialisation function is a good place to put any one-time run code, such as creation of global variables, spawning of timers, serial connections to hardware, etc.

Letâ€™s add a class variable called `current_emotion`, which we will initialise to an empty string and will be updated later. Letâ€™s also create a subscription to the topic `internal_thoughts`. The callback function supplied is the function thatâ€™s called when a new message is received.

Finally letâ€™s call the function `publish_emotions`, which we will write later.

```python
        self.current_emotion = ""
        self.create_subscription("internal_thoughts", self.process_thoughts)
        self.publish_emotions()
```

Letâ€™s create that callback function now. The message received is the first positional argument. In this case, the message received should be a string, so we can log a warning if itâ€™s not. The classâ€™ `log` method allows different error levels and provides consistent formatting for log messages.

```python
    def process_thoughts(self, msg):
        # Ensure the message is a string
        if not isinstance(msg, str):
            self.log.warning("Received non-string message")
            return
```

Letâ€™s search the message received for any emotion text, and update the current emotion variable if we find anything.

```python
        # Search the message for an emotion
        if "happy" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "happy"
        elif "sad" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "sad"
        elif "angry" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "angry"
```

As we know, robot brains are only capable of feeling these three basic emotions, so weâ€™ve covered all the bases here. Iâ€™ll leave you to improve the implementation of emotion checking if you feel like a challenge.

Letâ€™s write the other function, `publish_emotions`. The important lines are the `publish` method, which allows publishing of data onto the **nv** network, and the line which monitors the `stopped` event, used to ensure any loops exit when the node is terminated.

```python
    def publish_emotions(self):
        while not self.stopped.is_set():
            self.publish("emotions", self.current_emotion)
            time.sleep(1)
```

We now have everything we need for our new `HelloWorldNode` class. To keep itâ€™s simple, the next lines just create and start the node.

```python
hello_world_node = HelloWorldNode()
```

<aside>
ðŸš¨ Itâ€™s good convention to wrap your launch node in a `main` function, which only runs if the script is executed directly. We havenâ€™t done that here just to simplify things.

</aside>

All together, your node should look like this:

```python
import time

from nv import Node

class HelloWorldNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("my_first_node")

        self.current_emotion = ""
        self.create_subscription("internal_thoughts", self.process_thoughts)
        self.publish_emotions()

    def process_thoughts(self, msg):
        # Ensure the message is a string
        if not isinstance(msg, str):
            self.log.warning("Received non-string message")
            return

        # Search the message for an emotion
        if "happy" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "happy"
        elif "sad" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "sad"
        elif "angry" in msg:
            self.current_emotion = "angry"

    def publish_emotions(self):
        while not self.stopped.is_set():
            self.publish("emotions", self.current_emotion)
            time.sleep(1)

hello_world_node = HelloWorldNode()
```

Launching the node should display some debug information, finishing with a successful registration message. Terminate the node by sending a SIGINT command, typically by pressing `Ctrl+c`.

To test itâ€™s working, letâ€™s open two new terminals. In the first one, use **nv**cli to echo the output of the `emotions` topic. In the second, experiment with publishing data to the `internal_thoughts` topic.

# Improvements to the node

Although the node written is perfectly functional, there are some improvements which we can make. One issue with our implementation is that upon receiving a termination signal the loops will continue waiting (from `time.sleep`) for up to a whole loop duration. This doesnâ€™t matter much here where the loop duration is 1 second, but with loops of minutes or hours, this could cause major issues.

The **nv** framework provides helper functions for long-running loops, such as the one we created above.

We can use the `create_loop_timer` to create a separate thread which calls a specified function every n seconds. Termination when the node is destroyed is handled automatically. Additional arguments are passed to the function being called.

```python
# self.publish_emotions()
self.create_loop_timer(1, self.publish, "emotions", self.current_emotion)

self.spin()
```
