"""
Helpful example messages and related functions.

One of the primary benefits of the nv framework is that data transfer can be
done with nearly any standard data structure.

However, occasionally it's useful to transfer data in a more structured way.
For example, 'twist' messages allow you to specify a throttle and yaw velocity,
which is useful throughout various nodes.

At the end of the day, use of these are completely optional, but it might be
useful to create more intercompatible nodes.
